# pong
An implementation of the classic game Pong

Welcome to my Pygame version of the classic Pong! This game was created using Python 2.7.8 and Pygame 1.9.1.

This was one of my first attempts at coding with Pygame. Unlike my Asteroids program, this doesn't use complex structures or vector calculus.

Controls:
A - Player1 paddle UP       Up Arrow - Player2 paddle UP            D - Reduce ball speed
Z - Player1 paddle DOWN     Down Arrow - Player2 paddle DOWN        F - Increase ball speed

Enjoy!
